# Disco Capstone Project

###### Why learn when you can Disco?

### The Idea for [Disco](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/disco#Latin)

A tool for classrooms to gauge student comprehension and aid in lecture structure through analytics.

The name comes from the latin verb disc≈ç meaning "I learn".

---
### Description

The primary goal for this project is simplicity. The product is intended to be as simple and intuitive as possible to optimize user interaction. The user should not have to think to use the application, the application is to facilitate learning during the lecture, not hinder it.

Students and Lecturers log in from a central login page and after registration by email/password and setting 
whether they are a lecturer or student, may either create a "classroom" or request to join a classroom (similar to Slack channels).

Students and Lecturers have two different views when they enter the classroom and students will not be able to view any other student's
information except for anonymously marked topics for review and anonymous requests for a break. Lecturers will be able to view all student
input but will only see student information attached to Calls for help.
