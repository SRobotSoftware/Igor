### The Idea for Igor

An assistant for classrooms to gauge student comprehension in real time and aid in lecture structure through analytics.

---
### Description

The primary goal for this project is simplicity. The product is intended to be as simple and intuitive as possible to optimize user interaction. The user should not have to think to use the application, the application is to facilitate learning during the lecture, not hinder it.

Participants and Lecturers log in after registration by email/password and may either create a "classroom" or use a URL to join a classroom.

Participants and Lecturers have two different views when they enter the classroom and participants will not be able to view any other participants's information. Lecturers will be able to view all participant input in real time but will only see participant information information attached to Calls for help.
